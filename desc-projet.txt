End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Time-Series Forecasting (Energy or Finance)
Build a full workflow that forecasts electricity load or stock prices.
The system includes:
Data extraction task (Airflow DAG: pull from API/s3)
Data validation task using Great Expectations or Pandera
Kubeflow Pipeline that:
	trains a PyTorch LSTM/Transformer model
	performs HPO using Kubeflow Katib
	registers model in MLflow
Airflow task triggers batch inference daily
Model drift detection using EvidentlyAI
